    "In this tutorial I want to explain how to download and visualize Landsat-8 images using GEE and Python packages. I wrote this code originally for my [\"Using satellite and street level images to predict urban emissions\"](https://github.com/nicolas-suarez/urban_emissions/) project, and we struggled to download images in a simple way, and that's why I'm writing this tutorial."

    "After doing this, I'm going to define a function to download imagery called `image_task`. This function download satellite images centered around a point defined by latitude and longitude coordinates, with a certain size, and allows us to store them either on a Google Drive folder or in a Google Cloud bucket. **PENDING: add local storage with** [ee.Image.getDownloadURL](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-image-getdownloadurl)\n",

    "More specifically, we start by defining `len`, the total size of the image in meters, that is computed as the product of the resolution of our Landsat-8 SR images (30 meters) and the number of pixels we want to capture in the image. After that, we generate a circle around the point of interested, using as the radius half of our `len` parameter, and then we put a bounding box around the circle to get a square. We extract the coordinates of the bounding box and pass them to a `ee.Geometry.Rectangle` object called `rectangle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we only need to crop our `rectangle` object from our satellite image, called `image` here. Here, our image is going to be an `ee.ImageCollection` object defined to contain the `Landstat-8 SR`  collection for a specified time period, and defining the bands that we are going to use. We are going to generate a `task` that the Google Earth Engine is going to run later, where we are going to clip our `rectangle` area using the `filterBounds()` method, and then we use the `mean()` function to obtain a mean-composite of the images in the `ImageCollection` for the specified area. We also need to define the `region` where we are working (which is essentially the same as our `rectangle`, and the dimensions of our image (the number of pixels for the width and height)."
